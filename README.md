`ifallfalse` provides an environment that can compare a string against a set of another strings, and if it matches none of them, it executes some action.

## Package contents

- `README.md` this file
- `ifallfalse.pdf` documentation PDF with implementation details 
- `ifallfalse.dtx` contains package and documentation code
- `ifallfalse.ins` generates .sty from .dtx

## File generation

A working TeX installation is required.

Run

    tex ifallfalse.ins

to generate `ifallfalse.sty`. To use it, you need to put `ifallfalse.sty` into a directory searched by TeX.

Run

    pdflatex ifallfalse.dtx

to generate `ifallfalse.pdf`, which contains the package documentation.
